# LSTM hybrid model for short-term range climate data prediction from 1D time series  

Here an LSTM type of network model is proposed for advanced prediction of variations in one-dimensional
time series represention stochastic climate data. For the illustration prediction of physicochemical concentrations
in the Baltic Sea is performed with training data set from the past observational Boknis Data.

The model includes an extended Kalman Filter for refining of prediction by the LSTM network.
